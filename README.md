    <h2>HTML Code Writing Practice Page</h2>
    <p>Learning to code HTML. Hands-on experience in web developement is gained through trial and error. My goal is to continue to add to this code as I find time to practice.</p>
    <h3>Adding an Image</h3>
    <p>HTML images are defined with the < img > tag. It took a good minute to figure out how to upload the jpg file to GitHub so that it displayed nicely. I created this image in Canva using one of their free templates.</p>
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d42a039-9288-40ae-ba10-2fd3ddc5994f" alt="HTML" />
    <h3>Adding a Button</h3>
    <p>HTML buttons are defined with the < button > tag. Using CSS can improve visual effects and functionality when designing a webpage.</p> 
    <button type="button">Click Me!</button>
